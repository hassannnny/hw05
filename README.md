### Description  

<p> It’s good to get a hold of a planner 
and make a to-do list that contains everything. 
However, it’s even better to make a to-do list solely for school. 
A to-do list that is specific to 
academics will surely keep a student on top of 
what schoolwork needs to be done. Thereupon, a website that makes 
an academic to-do list would be the dream of a student. 
</p>
 

### Application 

<p>A user will be able to create their own account and set up their account with
a profile picture and basic information. The main dashboard will have the format 
of a calendar. A user can create up to 7 categories or classes and the user will 
be able to add whatever classwork and due date into the appropriate class category.
A group of users can edit a collective to-do list. Users in the group can chat with 
each other as well through a chat box.
